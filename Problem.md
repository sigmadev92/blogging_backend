## Problem Statement

### Create a blogging platform where people can read or write blogs, avail premium subscriptions. Interact with blogs. The application consists of 5 kinds of users.

- like and comment to blog
- Like the author, admin and creators profile
- Cannot write blogs
- cannot upload any thing except for profile pic and 2 professional links

- An author has more powers than a reader.

- A reader who holds the following eligibility can acquire the Author role:

  - read at least 10 free blogs and make a 10 day streak on the web App.
  - OR
  - read at least 2 premium blogs and have 3 days streak.
  - OR

- Free analytics of your blogs
- View readers profile for in depth analytics
- Put ads if traffic increases or followers exceeds 100.

### Moderator $100/M

- A moderator is bascially an admin of a community.
- An Author with atleast 1 month streak and 2 months account age can become eligible for creating community or can be made moderator by other moderators.
- An Author once eligible, can be a moderator of maximum 5 communities.
- An author can create only free commununites if he has less than 500 followers.
- On every 100 members in the community, a new moderator has to be added. If there are 200k members, then 2000 moderators should be there.
- If a moderator is incative for 1 week without notice, their community will add a new morderator with admin recommendation and the moderator will be degraded to Author profile.

### Admin - $1500/M

- An Author who has served as a moderator in 50 communites and has account age of atleast 1 year and streak of 6 months is eligible for becoming Admin. Number of followers doesn't matter.
- Once an Author becomes an admin, he get a salary of $1500 per month.
- An admin has to manage 1000 users. That is if the app has 1 million users, then there will be 1000 admins.
- still can write blogs but can not create communities or become moderator.
- He will be dismissed automatically from all other communites where he acts as a moderator except for his own created communities. However he has to make others as a moderator and his access will be paused till he is an admin.
- suggest new rules and regulation

### Creators - Elite Salaried Post + Ultimate benefits
